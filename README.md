### Dart Front-end ###

This was a low-effort project into learning dart for Angular 2.  It doesn't use some of the shortcuts and tools already developed for Typescript, which I have experience with, so it was a bit of an uphill battle. 

This project serves a single page and takes a while doing it, which doesn't quite serve the purpose of the project well.
